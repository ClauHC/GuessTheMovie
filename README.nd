This program is a movie title guessing game. The user has to guess the title of a movie from the letters given. The titles are randomly selected from a text file containing at least 10 titles. The letters are displayed as * and other characters, such as spaces or hyphens, are displayed as they are. At the end, the ranking of the players with the best scores is saved in a binary file, showing only the 5 best scores and giving you a “you are not worthy ⚒️” message if the score is low.
